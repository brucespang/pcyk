First Chicago Corp. said 0 it completed its $ 55.1 million *U* cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp. , another Chicago bank holding company .
The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline .
The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling *-1 to find enough river barges and trains 0 *T*-2 to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for * loading onto Soviet ships .
River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier .
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business .
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge *-1 to find enough of the crop 0 *T*-2 to meet their obligations to the Soviets .
The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn *ICH*-2 in October , which *T*-1 is the most ever sold * to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. .

The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered *-2 by January , which *T*-1 would be a strain in most years .
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which flows *T*-1 much of the U.S. corn that *T*-3 is shipped *-2 overseas .
`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said *T*-1 William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert .
`` It is going *-1 to be real tight . ''
Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges 0 their tows push *T*-1 at one time .
In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able *-2 to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning *-3 to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which *T*-1 feeds into the Mississippi River .
The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that *T*-1 feed it .
Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain *ICH*-3 this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation .
But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue *-1 falling this month .
At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed *-1 *T*-2 , an Army Corps spokesman said 0 *T*-3 .
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years .
So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade .
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded * there *-1 to calculate the price 0 they offer *T*-2 *-3 to buy corn from farmers .
At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel *-1 to settle at $ 2.375 *U* a bushel .
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted * by the 1988 drought .
With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try *-1 to gather the corn 0 they are obligated *-3 to deliver *T*-2 .
Farmers are in the best position of many years 0 * to push up corn prices *T*-1 .

Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .
In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 *U* a bushel for corn .

The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing *T*-1 .
However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , * eliminating income from those operations .
Among segments that *T*-1 continue *-2 to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued *-3 to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets .

Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled * with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results .
Moreover , USX exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .
The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which *T*-51 now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd .
In the steel division , operating profit dropped 11 % to $ 85 million *U* .

Still , USX fared better than other major steelmakers , *-3 earning more per ton of steel shipped * than either Bethlehem Steel Corp. , which *T*-1 posted a 54 % drop in net income , or Inland Steel Industries Inc. , whose profit *T*-2 plummeted 70 % .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX shares closed up $ 1.25 *U* , at $ 34.625 *U* , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who *T*-1 had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales .
The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' .
Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said 0 USX may have received orders lost * by competitors who *T*-2 were involved *-1 in labor contracts earlier this year .
He said 0 USX also appeared *-1 to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods .
The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest .
Higher crude oil prices helped *-1 boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million *U* from $ 180 million *U* .
The Texas Oil & Gas division continues *-1 to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $ 9 million *U* from $ 15 million *U* .

Two leading constitutional-law experts said 0 President Bush does n't have the legal authority * to exercise a line-item veto .
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said 0 any effort by President Bush 0 * to claim authority for a line-item veto *T*-1 would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .

Mr. Bush has said 0 he would like *-1 to be able *-2 to use this procedure .

But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority * to exercise a line-item veto . ''
The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
The two professors said 0 the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
Moreover , they said 0 the first appropriations bill passed * 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .
